"""THINGS TO FIX"
1. overlap function gives a NaN if the x values do not increase
FIXED - added the 'else: return 0' at the end of the function definition
2. loss gives a value greater than one for some things
problem 2 is likely due to this problem: overlap_fraction needs to be a matrix, not a vector. overlap from each turbine
to each turbine
FIXED
3. allow the wind to come from any direction, rather than always from the West
OVERLAP AND LOSS ARE FIXED
STILL NEED TO FIX THE GRAPHIC::
FIXED-(It's a little lopsided and doesn't keep constant distance between points, but it works!

THINGS TO MAKE IT BETTER
1. put more things into separate functions that can be used in any wake model
    a. Effective Velocity
    b. Power Calculation
    c. Rotation Matrix
    d. Plotting
